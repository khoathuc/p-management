## How we work with git ?

Our team needs to be clarify about git-workflow.

- **master**: master branch - Team memebers **must** create another branch and create pull request before merge.

- Branch's name needs to follow these conventions:
    [category]/[description]

    1. category: pull request category:
        - feature
        - bugfix
        - hotfix
        - experimental
        - build
        - release
        - merge
    2. description: pull request description:

    VD: <br>
    feature/integrate-swagger<br>
    bugfix/more-gray-shades<br>
